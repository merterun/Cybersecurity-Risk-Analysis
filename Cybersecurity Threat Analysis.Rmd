vendor_project: The name of the vendor or project affected by the vulnerability.
product: The name of the product affected by the vulnerability.
vulnerability_name: The name of the vulnerability.
date_added: The date the vulnerability was added to the dataset.
short_description: A brief description of the vulnerability.
required_action: The recommended action to be taken to remediate the vulnerability.
due_date: The date by which the recommended action should be taken.

The summary of the dataset shows that there are missing values in the notes, pub_date, cvss, and cwe columns. The due_date column has a minimum value of 2020-01-29, which is earlier than the earliest date in the date_added column. This might indicate some inconsistencies in the data that need to be resolved. The cvss column has a mean value of 8.412, indicating that the vulnerabilities in this dataset are generally of high severity. The complexity and severity columns are categorical variables.
