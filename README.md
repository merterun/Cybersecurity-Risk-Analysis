In this data analysis project, we're going to conduct a very comprehensive case study on cybersecurity risks, specifically focusing on the vulnerabilities reported in the year 2022. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset obtained from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), we aim to gain insights into the nature of these vulnerabilities, the affected products, and their potential impact on the security landscape.

The dataset provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was explored through ```Bayesian modeling, Bayesian networks```, comprehensive exploratory data analysis, ```K-means clustering```, and ```network analysis```.

Through extensive EDA, I gained insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data, ensuring data integrity. Bayesian modeling and networks were employed to estimate probabilities and dependencies, providing a comprehensive view of the vulnerabilities and their impacts. K-means clustering facilitated grouping similar vulnerabilities, aiding targeted mitigation strategies.

To visualize the network structure, traditional and advanced visualization librariries such as ```networkD3``` and ```Visnetwork``` were utilized. These visualizations depicted the interconnectedness of vulnerabilities, vendors, and products.
